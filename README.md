## Hey person who asked about R Shiny
Sorry I'm bad with names. This other repository might actually be more useful to you, the stuff in these is pretty different content wise but both are using shinydashboard as the main layout: https://github.com/joshqsumner/bioInformatics-HMM-app 

## Shiny App thing
https://josh-sumner.shinyapps.io/mod_2_wire/

Archived that on 2/22/21.

## Notes
Other stuff is here or in our washu teams folders. I'll probably scrap this in a few weeks after our presentation.
